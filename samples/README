In this folder you should see the following:
    
    running-tuscany/ - Instructions on how to run Tuscany in various different environments.
    
    getting-started/ - Introduction to SCA and the different features supported by Tuscany.
    
    applications/    - One example of an SCA web application running on Tuscany.
