Tuscany - Getting Started - Helloworld JSONP Sample
---------------------------------------------------

This sample extends the helloworld sample to make the helloworld service available as an HTTP endpoint using JSONP.
JSONP is a protocol supported by many Web clients that enables client requests to a server in a different domain.

The changes to the helloworld sample are:
- update the pom.xml with the additional dependencies
- update the composite to use the JSONP binding 

As with all the getting-started samples you can run this sample with:

   mvn tuscany:run 

Then at a web browser enter the following URL:

http://localhost:8080/HelloworldComponent/Helloworld/sayHello?name=world&callback=respFunc

which should return a page saying:

respFunc("Hello world");
