Tuscany - Getting Started - Helloworld SCAClient Sample
-------------------------------------------------------

This sample demonstrates using the OASIS SCAClient API to invoke a service in a remote SCA domain.

See the README in the top-level samples folder for general information on the Tuscany samples.

This project has a plain Java SE class with a main method which uses the OASIS SCAClient API to invoke a Helloworld service in a remote SCA domain.

Before running this sample you must have a helloworld service running in a SCA domain somewhere, for example, you can do that by using a separate command prompt to run one of the Tuscany "Getting Started" samples which provide a helloworld service, for examaple, helloworld, or helloworld-spring.
 
You can then run this SCAClient sample with the Maven command: 

   mvn tuscany:run

As this sample uses a standard Java SE main class you can also run it with the maven exec java plugin:

   mvn exec:java

You should see the following output:

   HelloworldSCAClient, using domainURI uri:default
   Calling HelloworldComponent.sayHello("world")
   Hello world
