Tuscany - Getting Started - Helloworld WebApp Sample
----------------------------------------------------

This sample demonstrates how to use SCA contributions with Web Applications

See the README in the top-level samples folder for general information on the Tuscany samples.

This sample project creates a .war web application which includes Tuscany. The SCA contribution
from the helloworld sample is included within the war and its SCA composite started by the webapp,
and there is a JSP page which shows how to invoke SCA services by using the SCA taglib.

As this sample creates a web application .war archive there is a manual step to deploy the WAR file
to your web application server. The archive is the helloworld-webapp-<version>.war in the target folder.
Alternatively, you can run it by using the Maven Tomcat plugin by using the following command:

   mvn tomcat:run

or if you prefer Jetty then:

   mvn jetty:run

Once the web app is running use your browser to visit the following URL;

http://localhost:8080/helloworld-webapp

(The port and hostname will of course vary depending on your local installation) 

You should then see the web page return the following:

   Calling HelloworldService sayHello("world") returns:

   Hello world
