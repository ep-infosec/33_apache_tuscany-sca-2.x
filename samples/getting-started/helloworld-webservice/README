Tuscany - Getting Started - Helloworld Web Service Sample
---------------------------------------------------------

This sample extends the helloworld sample to make the helloworld service available as a SOAP based Web Service endpoint.

The changes to the helloworld sample are:
- update the pom.xml with the additional dependencies
- update the composite to use the Web Service binding 

As with all the getting-started samples you can run this sample with:

   mvn tuscany:run 

You really need a Web Service client to invoke the service but you can get the WSDL description for the service by using a web browser with the following URL:

   http://localhost:8080/HelloworldComponent/Helloworld?wsdl

which should return the WSDL document for the service.
