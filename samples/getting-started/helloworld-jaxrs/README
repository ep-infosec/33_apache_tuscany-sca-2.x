Tuscany - Getting Started - Helloworld JAX-RS Sample
----------------------------------------------------

This sample extends the helloworld sample to make the helloworld service available as an HTTP endpoint by using JAX-RS and the Tuscany REST binding.

The changes to the helloworld sample are:
- update the pom.xml with the additional dependencies
- add a new Java interface which uses JAX-RS annotations
- update the composite to use the new interface and binding 

As with all the getting-started samples you can run this sample with:

   mvn tuscany:run 

Then at a web browser enter the following URL:

http://localhost:8080/HelloworldComponent/Helloworld/sayHello?name=world

which should return a page saying:

Hello world
