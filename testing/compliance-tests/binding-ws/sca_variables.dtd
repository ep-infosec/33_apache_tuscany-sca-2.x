<!-- 
 * This DTD forms part of the SCA Web Service Binding Test Suite.
 * It declares a number of XML Entities which are used in Entity References in some of the
 * composites that are artifacts used in the testcases.
 *
 * The values declared in the Entity References are intended to reflect SCA runtime specific
 * values for certain aspects of the composites at runtime - in particular addresses of some
 * services.
 *
 * It is permitted - indeed it is expected - that an SCA runtime provider will MODIFY the values
 * declared for the Entity References to match the values which would be expected when running the
 * SCA Web Service Binding test suite against a given SCA runtime.  The values held in the this file are
 * examples, derived from running the test suite against the Apache Tuscany SCA runtime.
