Tuscany - Getting Started - Helloworld Sample
---------------------------------------------

This sample demonstrates a simple helloworld style SCA application.

See the README in the top-level samples folder for general information on the Tuscany samples.

This project creates an SCA contribution with a deployable composite named helloworld.comosite.
The composite defines an SCA component, HelloworldComponent, which provides a Helloworld service, 
the component is implemented by a Java class. 

You can use the contribution by starting the composite in the Tuscany Shell. To do that run the 
the Tuscany Shell which can be started with the scripts in the Tuscany binary distribution 
bin folder. To do that run the following command at the root of a Tuscany binary distribution:

   bin\tuscany.bat samples\getting-started\helloworld-contribution  

Once the Shell has been started you may use Shell commands to explore
the SCA domain, for example, use the "installed" command to get the status of installed contributions, 
"services" to see the available component services, and you may test calling the helloworld service by 
using the "invoke" command:

   invoke HelloworldComponent sayHello yourName
